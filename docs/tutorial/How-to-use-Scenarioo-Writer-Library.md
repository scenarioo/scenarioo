# How to use Scenarioo Writer Libraries

## Existing Writer Libraries

Before you start using a Scenarioo Writer Library, it is a good idea to look at the [Core Concepts of Scenarioo](../features/README.md) first to understand the basics of the documentation that you want to generate by using such a writer library.

If you are using one of the following languages / frameworks, then you are lucky. You can just start writing documentation for Scenarioo using one of these libraries:

* [ScenariooJS for JavaScript Tests with Protractor or WebDriverJS](https://github.com/scenarioo/scenarioo-js/blob/master/README.md)

* [Scenarioo Writer for Java 6 and newer](https://github.com/scenarioo/scenarioo-java/blob/master/docs/usage.md)

* [Scenarioo Writer for C#](https://github.com/scenarioo/scenarioo-cs/wiki/How-to-use-the-C%23-Scenarioo-Writer-Library)

## Examples

See [Scenarioo Examples](../examples.md) for how to use this libraries and integrate them into your ui tests to produce documentation output from your UI tests.

## Other Languages / Frameworks

If you use any other language / framework, there's probably no Scenarioo Writer library out there yet and you have to start creating a new one, which is not too difficult. Please read the [Scenarioo-Writer-Documentation-Format](../features/Scenarioo-Writer-Documentation-Format.md) for this purpose and let us know if you create a library for other technologies.
